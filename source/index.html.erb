      After being an entrepreneur for a year and spending the last two months of my life at home, I longed to get some structure in my day. After class started at HackerYou, I got exactly what I wanted. Here is a breakdown of a typical day in my shoes.

    <h2>The Morning</h2>
    <p>
      My alarm goes off in the morning at 6:15AM. I get ready, have breakfast, pack lunch, and make my way to the train station on my trusty beater of a bike. I'm not wearing nearly enough and I'm freezing, but it's still early. Coding on the train helps me pass the time. Once I'm downtown, the day's a little warmer and I make my way to the gym for a quick workout. After the gym, I'm refreshed and ready for my day!

      More stairs! Stairs are a huge part of my day. Class starts at 10AM but I like to arrive slightly earlier. In the morning, we usually have a lesson on the topic of the day and work on exercises. After lunch, we learn a bit more and get some project work time until about 5pm. We end the day with a professional development workshop which is really helpful.

      The morning bit in reverse, minus the gym. I get home at around 8:30pm. It's late, so I'll usually skip dinner unless there's some amazing food at home. I unpack my bag, pack for the next day and it's time to get ready for bed.
